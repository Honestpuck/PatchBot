# PatchBot - Zero Touch Packaging and Patch Management

PatchBot is a software system for providing up to date applications across a Mac fleet. It leverages AutoPkg, the JAMF patch management system, and Jamf API to build a total solution where applications are provided to the fleet without human intervention.

It is described in a number of blog posts:

  - [PatchBot #3](https://macintoshguy.wordpress.com/patchbot-3/)
  - [PatchBot #4](https://macintoshguy.wordpress.com/patchbot-4)
  
 You can find the components in three GitHub repositories
